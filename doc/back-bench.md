## 4 Conclusion

Based on our comparative analysis, both frameworks have their distinct advantages:

- **Spring Framework** excels in enterprise-level applications requiring robust security, extensive computational capabilities, and comprehensive documentation. It's particularly well-suited for large-scale applications with complex business logic and strict security requirements.

- **NestJS** shines in scenarios requiring rapid development, lightweight implementation, and excellent I/O performance. It's ideal for modern web applications and microservices where quick scalability and lower resource consumption are priorities.

Given that this is a basic CRUD application with a login system developed by a single developer with Java experience, Spring Boot becomes a more attractive choice for these reasons:
- Leveraging existing Java knowledge reduces the learning curve significantly
- Built-in robust security features crucial for handling business documents
- Extensive documentation and mature ecosystem
- Strong type safety and better error handling out of the box
- Familiar development patterns and tools
- Future-proof choice: easier to scale vertically by deploying to a more powerful VPS if the application succeeds, rather than facing a potential technical debt of migrating from NestJS to Spring later

While NestJS offers lighter resource consumption and faster initial setup, the advantage of prior Java experience makes Spring Boot's learning curve less steep. The built-in security features and familiar development environment would likely lead to more confident and secure development, especially for business-critical documents like quotes and invoices.
